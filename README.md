# gpt-voice-web-app

This is an experiment in creating minimalistic pure client side web app that makes use of the Web Speech API to interact with OpenAI GPT models. The motivation for this was wanting a hands free way to converse with the AI.  

You can load a [working version of this app here](https://johnuiterwyk.github.io/gpt-voice-web-app/app/).
